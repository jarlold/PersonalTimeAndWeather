## Personal Time and Weather
I find most time and weather APIs are a pain in the butt to setup- especially free ones. Obviously for large
production-scale applications, it's worthwhile to jump through hoops for the increased reliability and uptime.
But if you just want to make an IRC bot, or sync the time on your home-servers, then you can skip the monthly
payments and use this.

## What Does It Do?
Nothing much, once setup it will serve the local time (in UTC) as well as the weather (read from the
[Government of Canada's weather site](https://weather.gc.ca/forecast/canada/index_e.html?id=ON))

## Setup & Installation
```
1. Make sure you have flask installed, as well as python
2. Clone the repo
3. To open a local test use: flask run
```
